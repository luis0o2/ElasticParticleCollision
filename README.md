# Particle Collision Simulation
A simple particle collision simulation implemented in C++ using the raylib library.

## Overview
This program simulates the movement and collision of particles within a confined space. Each particle has its own position, speed, and radius. The particles bounce off the walls and each other, reacting realistically to collisions.

## Features
Particle Creation: Press the SPACE key to add a new particle at the center of the screen with default speed.
Particle Centering: Press the E key to center all particles towards the center of the screen gradually.
Particle Collision: Particles bounce off each other and the walls of the window.
Particle Spawn: Press the R key to spawn 50 particles randomly across the screen.
Particle Deletion: Press the D key to delete all existing particles.
